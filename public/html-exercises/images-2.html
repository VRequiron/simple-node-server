    <p><font face="Arial">V As a Baby</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">I was born on July 31st, 1995. Venice Sr. and Rachel's third baby boy. From what I've heard, I was very "maarte" for a baby. Only my mom and dad could look at me, otherwise I would cry. I also didn't like being away from my mom, like most kids. <br><br><br>

        <p><font face="Arial">V As a Teenager</font></p>
        <p align="justify">Just like any other (angsty) teenager, I started having hobbies like playing volleyball and writing and doodling (especially during class. I really liked general science and biology. I became really active in school with extra curricular activities. I also joined a lot of contests outside our school. A lot happened when I was a teenager. Maybe it's why I feel so mature, since my formative years were so early.</p>

                <p><font face="arial">V As a Young Adult</font></p>
                <p align="justify">I decided to take up Economics despite my love for the written and spoken word. This was because I wanted to become a lawyer and if I had to choose a good pre-law degree (a fallback whether I decide to pursue law or not) It would be economics. I would say that going to UP was like being baptised in flames. Everything was new. And hard. But knowing that I shared the burden made it hurt less. I found a family in the form of the UPLB Economics Society. And I can say that college is where you'll truly meet the people you truly and enitrely trust.</p>

         <p align="Justify"><font face="arial">V As a Success Story</font></p>
         <br>
         <p align="Justify">To be honest, I don't actually know where I'll be in the near future. I know where I want to go and I know who I want to be, but if life has taught me one thing, it's that you never really get to decide. But what I'm sure of is that I'll give all of myself to the profession I choose. Promise.</p>
