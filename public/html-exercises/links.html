        <h2>FUELED BY POPCORN: MY FAVORITES</h2>
        <em>Top 3 Must-Watch movies</em>
        <p>Third on my list of my most favorite movies is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA7FCTMUfpE">"The Devil Wears Prada"</a>! This movie tells the story of Andrea (Anne Hathaway), a journalist, looking for work. She applies for a magazine publishing company and gets accepted as Miranda Priestly's (Meryl Streep) personal assistant. This movie is one of my favorites since it combines two of the things I love the most, writing and fashion.</p>
        <p>My second all time favorite movie is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOUcElYkTCI">"Pitch Perfect"</a>! The reason I love this movie is no just because of the story, but because of the music in the movie itself. As a music lover, it made me see music in a different way. And it made me appreciate acapella. </p>
        <p>And my most favorite movie of all time and eternity is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RbMZPL1bsw">"Love of Siam"</a>!!! It's my favorite since it tackles how homosexuality starts in the mind of a young person, much like how it affected me and my life. I get so emotional every single time I watch this movie, especially, in the ending where they don't end up together. The feels you get from this movie is just ughhhh. </p>

        <em>Top 3 Must-Hear songs</em>
        <p>The third spot goes to Paloma Faith and her masterpiece of a song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHxO5PBNMnU">Just Be</a>. The thing I love about this song is its rawness and how she just let the emotions be the focal point of the whole song. Another thing I absolute adore is how she sings and interprets her lyrics. She just takes it to another level.</p>
        <p>The second spot goes to Sam Smith's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB-5XG-DbAA">Stay With Me</a>. The first time I heard this song, I was almost in tears. The way the elements of the song were put together was just magical. For me, an english song that deals with this kind of emotion almost always gets too peotic, but this song is just really blunt and real. </p>
        <p>And my most favorite song of all time is the song that started it all for Sam Smith, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVJcLcuQdOw">Lay Me Down</a>. It's the song that got him his first record deal and he wrote it when he was just 19 years old. What I absolutely love about the song is its versatility. It isn't just about the kind of love that's romantic, the song is applicable to all kinds of love. And Sam Smith's vocals are just on point in this song.</p>
