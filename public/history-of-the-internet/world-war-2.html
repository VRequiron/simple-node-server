				<p>During the 2nd world war, communication was done through the use of radiowaves to transmit simple messages. Soldiers in the US were trained on how to operate radios. When soldiers go out into the field, they carry portable radios so that they can report their situation to the military bases. The radios were also effective in a way that it was used to transmit commands to soldiers efficiently. But there was one problem, radio communication relied heavily on radiowaves which travel through the ionosphere. In the presence of a nuclear war, the ionosphere would be destroyed due to radiation and soldiers would not be able to communicate with each other. And in October 4, 1957 during the cold war, Sputnik I was sent into orbit by the Soviet Union. The fear of a missile emerged which forced the US to establish the Defense Advanced Research Project or DARPA in February of 1958.</p>
				<p><strong>DARPA</strong> planned a large scale computer network to accelerate knowledge transfer. This network would become the <strong>ARPANET</strong>. Three other concepts were to be developed like the military network by the RAND corporation in the United States, the commercial network of National Physical Laboratory in England and the scientific network called CYCLADES in France. All of these were important in the development of the modern internet.</p>
