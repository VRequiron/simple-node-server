				<p>Before the high-speed internet that we are familiar with today, communication had a lot of development to undergo. For example, computers had <strong>batch processing</strong> in which only one command or process can be done by the computer at a time. Other than time consuming, computers back then were really large and had to placed in cool rooms to avoid overheating. Computers back then also required a lot of effort, there was a lot of manual programming to be done and it had to be done through a computer connected to the mainframe. </p>
				<p>An improvement they made from batch processing is <strong>packet switching</strong>. In packet switching, the whole file or message isn't sent in one piece. The file is cut into packets of information and are sent one at a time and are reassembled at the receiver.</p>
				<p>To further organize the sharing of knowledge using the internet, the <strong>Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol</strong> (TCP/IP) was developed. </p>
